# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is created to explore the concept of Requirement Analysis in Software Development. It will cover definitions, importance, key activities, types of requirements, and visual use case diagrams to better understand this crucial SDLC phase.
## What is Requirement Analysis?


Requirement Analysis is the process of determining user expectations for a new or modified product. These requirements must be clear, complete, and agreed upon by all stakeholders.

It plays a crucial role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as it lays the foundation for designing, developing, and testing a software system.
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Minimizes Rework**: Identifying accurate requirements early prevents costly changes later.
2. **Improves Communication**: Clear requirements help align developers, testers, and clients.
3. **Enhances Quality**: Well-defined requirements ensure the final product meets user needs.
## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.

- **Requirement Gathering**: Collecting requirements from stakeholders.
- **Requirement Elicitation**: Techniques like interviews, surveys, and brainstorming to explore requirements deeply.
- **Requirement Documentation**: Recording all gathered information clearly and formally.
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**: Organizing, analyzing, and sometimes visualizing the requirements.
- **Requirement Validation**: Ensuring requirements are complete, correct, and agreed upon by stakeholders.
## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
These describe what the system should do.
- Example: The system shall allow users to book appointments online.

### Non-functional Requirements
These define system attributes like performance, usability, etc.
- Example: The system should load pages within 2 seconds under normal conditions.
## Acceptance Criteria.
1. User must be able to review all selected services before payment.
2. The system should calculate the total price including tax and discounts.
3. The payment should be processed using integrated payment gateways (e.g., PayPal, Credit Card).
4. A confirmation page must be shown after successful payment.
5. An invoice must be sent to the userâ€™s registered email.
