# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is created to explore the concept of Requirement Analysis in Software Development. It will cover definitions, importance, key activities, types of requirements, and visual use case diagrams to better understand this crucial SDLC phase.
## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of determining user expectations for a new or modified product. These requirements must be clear, complete, and agreed upon by all stakeholders.

It plays a crucial role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as it lays the foundation for designing, developing, and testing a software system.
